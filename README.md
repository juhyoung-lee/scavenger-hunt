# AR6 Duke Scavenger
We are developing a Duke scavenger hunt app to help freshman get aquainted with campus! There will be different options that students can choose from to get them aquainted with specific locations. For instance, students will be able to choose along their major to learn where their classes might be, or they could choose "places I wish I knew about as a freshman" to learn about places like Divinity Cafe and the puppy kindergarten. Beyond freshman orientation, this app could be easily adapted to prospective or visiting students as a guided tour! Clubs and organizations could even apply for their own themed scavenger hunt, such as for Black History Month, with their own sprites and memos!
